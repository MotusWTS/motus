 This is a quick introduction to downloading Motus data. Definitely check out the various [articles](../index.html) for more details!
 
 Let's get started by loading the packages we'll use (see also [Chapter 2 - Installing packages](02-installing-packages.html).)
+
 ```{r, message = FALSE}
 library(motus)
 library(dplyr)
 library(lubridate)
 ```
 
-Now we'll download some data. 
-Here we're downloading project 176 (sample data, use user name and password 'motus.sample').
-You can use your own project number or receiver name.
+Now we'll download some data, using the `tagme()` function.
 
-We use the `tagme()` function to download the data
-```{r}
+We have a choice between two different datasets to download.
+
+1)  By *receiver*. This will download all the detection data for the tags detected by a particular receiver, regardless of what projects deployed the tags.
+
+2)  By *project.* This will download all the detection data for the tags deployed by a particular project, regardless of what projects manage the receivers.
+
+Either way, when you download motus data with the `tagme()` function the data is stored locally on your computer as a SQLite dastabase with the file extension of `.motus`. If you downloaded a receiver data the file name will look something like "SG-123RPI456.motus" and if you downloaded a project tag database the file name will look something like "Project-123.motus".
+
+[You must be part of the project in question to download receiver or tag data. You can't download data from a project you aren't a member of.]
+
+COMMENT: More about the structure of the data. This was in the earlier iteration, and may well (properly) be part of the documentation of the `tagme()` function. But we have to keep in many that many users of Motus are also first time R users and won't know to look at the function documentation to know what's going on.
+
+Here we're downloading project 176 (sample data, use user name and password 'motus.sample'). You can use your own project number or receiver name.
+
+```{r, eval=F}
 sql.motus <- tagme(176, new = FALSE, update = TRUE, dir = "./data/")
 ```
 
 `tagme()` includes several options. Here we're using:
 
-- `new = FALSE` means the data base already exists, if it doesn't, change `FALSE` to `TRUE`
-- `dir = "./data/"` means the data base will be stored in the `data` folder inside your current working directory
+-   `new = FALSE` means the data base already exists, if it doesn't, change `FALSE` to `TRUE`
+-   `dir = "./data/"` means the data base will be stored in the `data` folder inside your current working directory
 
 `tagme()` stores a `project-176.motus` SQLite data base in `./data/`.
 
 We can access parts of the data base by referencing the SQL object we created, `sql.motus`
 
 Here, we'll retrieve the `alltags` view from the SQLite database using the `tbl()` function from the `dplyr` package
+
 ```{r}
 tbl.alltags <- tbl(sql.motus, "alltags")
 ```
