\title{Map of tag routes and sites coloured by id}
\usage{
plotRouteMap(data, zoom = 3, lat = NULL, lon = NULL,
  maptype = "terrain", recvStart = NULL, recvEnd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a .motus sql file}

\item{zoom}{integer.  Values between 3 and 21, 3 being continent level, 10 being city-scale}

\item{lat}{numeric vector. Top and bottom latitude bounds. If NULL (default)
this is calculated from the data}

\item{lon}{numeric vector. Left and right longitude bounds. If NULL
(default) this is calculated from the data}

\item{maptype}{map type to display, can be: "terrain" , "toner",
"watercolor", or any other option available to
\code{\link[ggmap]{get_stamenmap}()}.}

\item{recvStart}{start date for date range of active receivers. If NULL uses
the full data range}

\item{recvEnd}{end date for date range of active receivers. If NULL uses the
full data range}
}
\description{
Google map of routes of Motus tag detections coloured by ID.  User defines a date range to show
points for receivers that were operational at some point during the date range.
}
\details{
By default this function uses Stamen maps
}
\examples{
# You must use a .motus sql file, instructions to load using tagme() are
# below

# download and access data from project 176 in sql format
# usename and password are both "motus.sample"
\dontrun{sql.motus <- tagme(176, new = TRUE, update = TRUE)}

# OR use example sql file included in `motus`
sql.motus <- tagme(176, update = FALSE, 
                   dir = system.file("extdata", package = "motus"))

# Plot routemap of all detection data, with "terrain" maptype, and receivers
# active between 2016-01-01 and 2017-01-01
plotRouteMap(sql.motus, recvStart = "2016-01-01", recvEnd = "2016-12-31")
