filterByActivity(
  src,

  view = "alltags",
  minLen = 3,
  maxLen = 5,

}
\arguments{
\item{src}{SQLite connection. Result of \code{tagme(XXX)} or
\code{DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "XXX.motus")}.}

\item{return}{Character. One of "good" (return only 'good' runs), "bad"
(return only 'bad' runs), "all" (return all runs, but with a new
\code{probability} column which identifies 'bad' (0) and 'good' (1) runs.}

\item{view}{Character. Which view to use, one of "alltags" (faster) or
"alltagsGPS" (with GPS data).}

\item{minLen}{Numeric. The minimum run length to allow (equal to or below
this, all runs are 'bad')}

\item{maxLen}{Numeric. The maximum run length to allow (equal to or above
this, all runs are 'good')}

\item{maxRuns}{Numeric. The cutoff of number of runs in a batch (see Details)}

\item{ratio}{Numeric. The ratio cutoff of runs length 2 to number of runs in
a batch (see Details)}

\description{
The \code{activity} table is used to identify batches with too much noise.
Depending on the value of \code{return} these are filtered out, returned, or
identified in the \code{alltags} view with the column \code{probability}. \strong{No changes
to the database are made.}
}
\details{
Runs are identified by the following:
\itemize{
\item All runs with a length >= \code{maxLen} are \strong{GOOD}
\item All runs with a length <= \code{minLen} are \strong{BAD}
\item Runs with a length between \code{minLen} and \code{maxLen} are \strong{BAD} IF both of the
following is true:
\itemize{
\item belong to a batch where the number of runs is >= \code{maxRuns}
\item the ratio of runs with a length of 2 to the number of runs total
is >= \code{ratio}
}
}
}
\examples{
# Download sample project 176 to .motus database (username/password are "motus.sample")
\dontrun{sql_motus <- tagme(176, new = TRUE)}

# Or use example data base in memory
sql_motus <- tagmeSample()

tbl_good <- filterByActivity(sql_motus)
tbl_bad <- filterByActivity(sql_motus, return = "bad")
tbl_all <- filterByActivity(sql_motus, return = "all")
