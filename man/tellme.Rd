\title{report how much new data motus has for a tag detection database}
\usage{
tellme(projRecv, new = FALSE, dir = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{projRecv}{integer scalar project code from motus.org, *or*
character scalar receiver serial number}

\item{new}{logical scalar: is this a new database?  Default: FALSE
You have to specify \code{new=TRUE} if you want a new local copy of the
database to be created.  Otherwise, \code{tellme()} assumes the database
already exists, and will stop with an error if it cannot find it
in the current directory.  This is mainly to prevent inadvertent
downloads of large amounts of data that you already have!}

\item{dir:}{path to the folder where you are storing databases
Default: the current directory; i.e. \code{getwd()}}
}
\value{
a named list with these items:
\itemize{
   \item numBatches: number of batches having data for your database
   \item numRuns: number of runs of tags detections with new data
   \item numHits: number of new detections
   \item numGPS: number of new GPS fixes covering the new detections
   \item numBytes: estimated size of download, in bytes.  This is
         an estimate of the \emph{uncompressed} size, but
         data are gz-compressed for transfer, so the number of bytes
         you have to download is typically going to be smaller than
         this number by a factor of 2 or more.
}
}
\description{
"new" means data not already in your local database.
}
\note{
if you specify \code{new=TRUE} and the database does not already exist,
it will be created (but empty).
