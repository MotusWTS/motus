\title{Report how much new data motus has for a tag detection database}
\usage{
tellme(projRecv, new = FALSE, dir = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{projRecv}{Numeric project code from motus.org, \emph{or} character receiver
serial number.}

\item{new}{Logical. Is this a new database?  Default: FALSE You have to
specify \code{new = TRUE} if you want a new local copy of the database to be
created. Otherwise, this function assumes the database already exists,
and will stop with an error if it cannot find it in the current directory.
This is mainly to prevent inadvertent downloads of large amounts of data
that you already have!}

\item{dir}{Character. Path to the folder where you are storing databases
Defaults to current directory; i.e. \code{getwd()}.}
}
\value{
a named list with these items:
\itemize{
\item numBatches: number of batches having data for your database
\item numRuns: number of runs of tags detections with new data
\item numHits: number of new detections
\item numGPS: number of new GPS fixes covering the new detections
\item numBytes: estimated size of download, in bytes.  This is an estimate of the
\emph{uncompressed} size, but data are gz-compressed for transfer, so the number
of bytes you have to download is typically going to be smaller than this
number by a factor of 2 or more.
}
}
\description{
"new" means data not already in your local database.
}
\note{
if you specify \code{new = TRUE} and the database does not already exist, it
will be created (but empty).
