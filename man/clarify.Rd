\title{report on or claim ambiguous tag detections}
\usage{
clarify(s, id, from, to, all.mine = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{dplyr::src to the tag database, as returned by \code{tagme()}}

\item{id}{if not missing, a vector of negative motus ambiguous tag IDs
for which you wish to claim detections.  If missing, all tags are claimed
over any period specified by \code{from} and \code{to}.}

\item{from}{if not missing, the start time for your claim to
ambiguous detections of tag(s) \code{id}.  If missing, you are
claiming all detections up to \code{to}.  \code{from} can be a
numeric timestamp, or a character string compatible with
\code{lubridate::ymd}}

\item{to}{if not missing, the end time for your claim to ambiguous
detections of tag(s) \code{id}.  If missing, you are claiming
all detections after \code{from}.  \code{to} can be a numeric
timestamp, or a character string compatible with
\code{lubridate::ymd}}

\item{all.mine}{logical; if TRUE, claim all ambiguous detections.
In this case, \code{id, from} and \code{to} are ignored.

If both \code{from} and \code{to} are missing, then all detections of
ambiguous tag(s) \code{id} are claimed.

Parameters \code{id}, \code{from}, and \code{to} are recycled to the
length of the longest item.

When you claim an ambiguous tag \code{T} for a period, any runs of \code{T}
which overlap that period at all are claimd entirely, even if they extend
beyond the period; i.e. runs are not split.}
}
\value{
with no parameters, returns a summary data frame of ambiguous tag detections, with these columns
\itemize{
\item ambigID; integer: negative motus ambiguous tag ID, representing multiple possible real tags
\item numHits; numeric: total number of detections of this ambiguity
\item id1; integer: first possible motus ID of real tag that this detection might represent
\item fullID1; character: fullID for first possible real tag, in "Project#MFGID:BI@NOMFREQ(M.MotusID)" format
\item id2; integer: second possible motus ID of real tag that this detection might represent
\item fullID2; character: fullID for second possible real tag, in same format as fullID1
\item ...
\item id6; integer: sixth possible motus ID of real tag that this detection might represent
\item fullID6; character: fullID for sixth possible real tag, in same format as fullID1
\item motusTagID; integer tag ID ambiguity was resolved to over some period
\item tsStart; numeric: timestamp of start of period for this ambiguity resolution
\item tsEnd; numeric: timestamp of end of period for this ambiguity resolution
}
}
\description{
A detections is "ambiguous" if the motus tag finder could not tell
which of several tags was detected, because they all produce the
same signal and were active at the same time.  The motus tag finder
uses tag deployment and lifetime metadata to decide what tags to
seek when, and notices when it can't distinguish between two or
more of them.  Detections of such tags during these periods of
overlap are assigned a negative motus tag ID that represents from 2
to 6 possible real motus tags.  The ambiguities might be real
(i.e. two or more tags transmitting the same signal and active at
the same time), or due to errors in tag registration or deployment
metadata.

\details{
This function serves two purposes:

\itemize{
\item called with only a database dplyr::src, it reports the numbers
of ambiguous detections and what they could represent.
\item called with \code{id}, it lets you claim some of the ambiguities
as your own tag, so that in subsequent processing, they will appear
to be yours.
}

This function does not (yet?) report your claim to motus.org

WARNING: you cannot undo a claim within a copy of the database.  If
unsure, copy the .motus file first, then run \code{clarify} on only
one copy.

\examples{
## s = tagme(57) ## get a dplyr::src to the tag database for project 57
## clarify(s)  ## report on the ambiguous tag detections in s
## clarify(all.mine=TRUE) ## claim all ambiguous tag detections as mine
## clarify(id = -57) ## claim all detections of ambiguous tag -57 as mine
## clarify(id = c(-72, -88, -91), from=("2017-01-02"), to=("2017-05-06")) 
## claim all detections of ambiguous tags -72, -88, and -91 from
##   January 2 through May 6, 2017, as mine
