\usage{
getGPS(src, data = NULL, by = "daily", cutoff = NULL,
  keepAll = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{src}{src_sqlite object representing the database}

\item{data}{src_sqlite object or data.frame. Optional subset of the \code{alltags}
view. Must have \code{ts}, \code{hitID} and \code{batchID} at the minimum.}

\item{by}{Numeric/Character. Either the time in minutes over which to join GPS
locations to hits, or "daily" or "closest". To join GPS locations by daily
time blocks or by the closest temporal match (see Details).}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric. The maximum allowable time in minutes between hit and
GPS timestamps when matching hits to GPS with \code{by = 'closest'}. Defaults to
\code{NULL} (no maximum).}

\item{keepAll}{Logical. Return all hits regardless of whether they have a GPS
match? Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
Data frame linking hitID to gpsLat, gpsLon and gpsAlt
}
\description{
To improve speed, the \code{alltags} view doesn't include GPS-related variables
such as \code{gpsLat}, \code{gpsLon}, or \code{gpsAlt}. There is a \code{alltagsGPS} view that
does include GPS-related variables, but this will take time to load. This
function accepts a source and returns the GPS data associated with the
\code{batchID}/\code{hitID} combos in the \code{alltags} view. Optionally, users can supply a
subset of the \code{alltags} view to return only GPS data associated with the
specific \code{batchID}/\code{hitID} combos present in the subset.
}
\details{
There are three different methods for matching GPS data to \code{batchID}/\code{hitID}
combos, all related to timestamps (\code{ts}).
\enumerate{
\item \code{by = X} Where \code{X} is a duration in minutes. \code{ts} is converted to a
specific time block of duration \code{X}. Median GPS lat/longs for the time block
are returned, matching associated \code{batchID}/\code{hitID} time blocks.
\item \code{by = "daily"} (the default). Similar to \code{by = X} except the duration is
24hr.
\item \code{by = "closest"} Individual GPS lat/lons are returned, matching the
closest \code{batchID}/\code{hitID} timestamp. Use \code{cutoff} to specify the maximum
allowable time between timestamps (defaults to none).

\examples{

# download and access data from project 176 in sql format
# usename and password are both "motus.sample"
\dontrun{sql.motus <- tagme(176, new = TRUE, update = TRUE)}

# OR use example sql file included in `motus`
sql.motus <- tagme(176, update = FALSE, 
                   dir = system.file("extdata", package = "motus"))

# Match hits to GPS within 24hrs (daily) of each other
my_gps <- getGPS(sql.motus)
my_gps

# Note that the sample data doesn't have GPS hits so this will be an 
# empty data frame for project 176.

# Match hits to GPS within 15min of each other
my_gps <- getGPS(sql.motus, by = 15)
my_gps

# Match hits to GPS according to the closest timestamp
my_gps <- getGPS(sql.motus, by = "closest")
my_gps

# Match hits to GPS according to the closest timestamp, but limit to within
# 20min of each other
my_gps <- getGPS(sql.motus, by = "closest", cutoff = 20)
my_gps

# To return all hits, regardless of whether they match a GPS record

my_gps <- getGPS(sql.motus, keepAll = TRUE)
my_gps

# Alternatively, use the alltagsGPS view:
dplyr::tbl(sql.motus, "alltagsGPS")
