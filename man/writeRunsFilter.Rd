\arguments{
\item{src}{SQLite connection (result of \code{tagme(XXX)} or
\code{DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "XXX.motus")})}

\item{filterName}{unique name given to the filter}

\item{motusProjID}{optional project ID attached to the filter in order to share with other users of the same project.}

\item{df}{dataframe containing the runID, the motusTagID and probability values to save in the local database}

\item{overwrite}{boolean. When TRUE ensures that existing records matching the same filterName
and runID get replaced}

\item{delete}{boolean. When TRUE, removes all existing filter records associated with the filterName
and re-inserts the ones contained in the dataframe. This option should be used if the dataframe
provided contains the entire set of filters you want to save.}
