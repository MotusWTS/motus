hitID,Unique Motus ID for this tag detection
runID,Unique Motus ID for the run this detection belongs to
batchID,Unique Motus ID for the processing batch this detection came from
ts,"Timestamp, in seconds since 1 Jan, 1970 UTC; precision: 0.1 ms (SG); 2.5 ms (Lotek). "
sig,"Signal strength in ""native units""; for SG: dB (max) (logarithmic, 0 = max possible, -10 = 0.1 * max, etc.); for Lotek: raw value (0...255)"
sigsd,Standard deviation in signal strength among pulses in this burst. SG Only; NA for Lotek
noise,"Estimate of background radio noise when tag detected, in dB (max) for SG; NA for Lotek"
freq,"Frequency offset from antenna listening frequency, in kHz for SG only; NA for Lotek"
freqsd,"Standard deviation of frequency offset among pulses in this burst, in kHz. Values larger than 0.1 kHz suggest a bogus detection. SG only; NA for Lotek. "
slop,Total absolute difference (milliseconds) in inter-pulse intervals for this burst between registration and detection. SG only; NA for Lotek
burstSlop,Signed difference (seconds) between detection and registration burst intervals. This is always 0 for the first burst in a run.
done,Whether or not the run is finished
motusTagID,"Motus tag ID, unique to each individual tag registered"
ambigID,Ambiguous ID assigned to ambiguous tags
port,Port number that the detection occurred on
runLen,Number of tag bursts in the current run; constant for all records having the same runID
bootnum,Boot session of receiver for SG; NA for Lotek
tagProjectID,ID of the project that manages this tag.
mfgID,Manufacturer ID
tagType,
codeSet,"For coded tags, the name of the codeset (e.g. 'Lotek-3')"
mfg,Tag manufacturer
tagModel,Manufacturer's model name for a tag (e.g. 'NTQB-3-2')
tagLifespan,Estimated lifespan of tag (days)
nomFreq,"Nominal tag frequency  (Nominal frequency receiver was tuned to, in Mhz. This really only applies to SG, where we usually tune 4 kHz below the nominal tag frequency. So in that case, antFreq = 166.376 while nomFreq = 166.380)"
tagBI,"Burst interval of tag, in seconds (e.g., 5.8984)"
pulseLen,"Tag pulse length (milliseconds), if applicable. This value is only assigned based on the sample recording of the tag."
tagDeployID,Motus tag deployment ID
speciesID,Unique numeric Motus ID for the species on which the tag was deployed
markerNumber,"Number for any additional marker placed on organism (e.g., bird band #)"
markerType,Type of additional marker (e.g. metal band)
tagDeployStart,Tag deployment start date
tagDeployEnd,Tag deployment end date
tagDeployLat,"Latitude of tag deployment, in decimal degrees N (negative values for Southern hemisphere)"
tagDeployLon,"Longitude of tag deployment, in decimal degrees E (negative values for Western hemisphere)"
tagDeployAlt,"Altitude of tag deployment, in meters ASL"
tagDepComments,Additional comments or unclassified metadata for tag (often in JSON format)
fullID,Full tag ID as PROJECT#MFGID:BI@NOMFREQ. Not necessarily unique over time. See motusTagID for a unique tag
deviceID,Motus device ID associated with the receiver serial number
recvDeployID,Receiver deployment ID
recvDeployLat,"Latitude of receiver deployment,  in decimal degrees N (negative values for Southern hemisphere)"

recvDeployAlt,"Altitude of receiver deployment, in meters ASL"
recv,"Serial number of the receiver; e.g., SG-1234BBBK5678 or Lotek-12345"
recvDeployName,Name assigned to the receiver deployment by the project manager
recvSiteName,Name assigned to a site by the project manager (e.g. location name). The same label can be used for multiple deployments.
isRecvMobile,Whether or not the sensor is deployed on a mobile platform (eg. a ship)
recvProjID,"Unique numeric ID of the project that deployed this receiver (e.g., 8)"
antType,"Antenna type, e.g. ""9-element Yagi"", ""Omni"""
antBearing,Compass direction antenna main axis is pointing at (degrees clockwise from local magnetic North 0-360)
antHeight,Height (meters) of antenna main axis above ground
speciesEN,Species English (common) name
speciesFR,Species French (common) name
speciesSci,Species scientific name
speciesGroup,"Species group, e.g., BIRDS, BATS"
tagProjName,"Short label of project that deployed the tag, e.g., ""HolbSESA"""
recvProjName,"Short label of project that deployed the receiver e.g., ""HolbSESA"""
gpsLat,Latitude of receiver GPS location at time of writing the hourly detections file (degrees North)
gpsLon,Longitude of receiver GPS  location at time of writing the hourly detections file (degrees East)
gpsAlt,Altitude of receiver GPS at time of writing the hourly detections file (meters)
