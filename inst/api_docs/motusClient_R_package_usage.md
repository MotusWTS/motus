# Using the motus R package #

This document outlines how to use the
[motusClient R package](https://github.com/jbrzusto/motusClient) to obtain
your motus detection data.  Most users should instead work with the
[motus R package](https://github.com/jbrzusto/motus), which uses `motusClient`
to fetch data, but also provides functions to work with it.

## Installation ##

You can install it from R by doing:
```R
    install.packages("devtools")              ## if you haven't already done this
    library(devtools)
    install_github("jbrzusto/motusClient")   ## the lastest stable version
```

## Authentication ##

The first time you call a function in the motusClient package that needs to
authenticate you at motus.org, you will be asked for a username and
password.  This will only happen once per R session.  You can supply
your credentials from an R script like so:

```R
   library(motusClient)
   ...
   motusLogout() ## only needed if changing login credentials during an R session
   Motus$userLogin = "username"
   Motus$userPassword = "secret"
```

## Tag Databases ##

Your copy of a tag database is stored as an [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org)
file with the extension `.motus`, whose schema is described in another
document.

There are two *flavours* of tag database:

1. **receiver database**: all detections of any tags from a single receiver.
A receiver database has a name like `SG-1234BBBK5678.motus`; where the name
is the serial number of the receiver.

1. **tag project database**: all detections of *your* tags from across the motus network
A tag project database has a name like `project-123.motus`, where the number
is the motus project ID.

These correspond to the basic model of data sharing:

1. you get all detections of anyone's tags by *your* receivers (so, one receiver tag database
for each receiver you deploy)

1. you get all detections of *your* tags by *anyone's* receivers (so, one project tag database
for each of your motus projects)

Internally, the databases formats are almost identical, but a table called "meta" has fields
that differ between the two.

The sqlite format was chosen because:

1. it is flexible, allowing for many data formats

1. it is accessible from many software platforms (not just R) because SQLite bindings are
available for all major programming languages

1. it is **appendable**: the database can be created and updated on disk without
having to read in and resave the entire contents.

Points 2 and 3 are in contrast to the native R `.rds` format.  `.rds` format has the benefit
of taking up less space on disk, but accessing *any* data from it requires reading *all* of it
into memory.

## R functions to create and update your tag database ##

The motusClient package provides one basic function to create and update
tag databases of both kinds.  Here's how it works:

```R
library(motusClient)

# create and open a local tag database for motus project 14 in the
# current directory, but do not fetch any data for it.

db = tagme(14, new=TRUE)

# update and open the local tag database for motus project 14;
# it must already exist and be in the current directory

db = tagme(14)

# update and open the local tag database for a receiver;
# it must already exist and be in the current directory

db = tagme("SG-1013BB000626")

# open the local tag database for a receiver, without
# updating it

db = tagme("SG-1013BB000626", update=FALSE)

# update all existing local tag or receiver databases

tagme() ## with no recveiver or project

```
Each of these functions returns a `dplyr::src_sqlite` that refers to the
database file on disk.  So you can use all the dplyr functions to
filter and summarize your data.  The format of tables in these databases
is described elsewhere.  Most users will find the table called `alltags`
has everything they need.

For example, to find the first hourly detection of each tag in each hour
by receiver and antenna, you could do this:

```R
library(motusClient)
db = tagme(8)
t = tbl(db, "alltags")
hourly = t %>% mutate (hour = 3600 * round(ts / 3600, 0)) %>% distinct (serno, ant, tagID, hour)

## collect these into a data.frame

hh = hourly %>% collect %>% as.data.frame

## adjust column types so xyplot() treats them specially

hh$tagID = as.factor(hh$tagID)
class(hh$hour) = class(Sys.time())

## plot tag ID vs. time, grouping by (receiver, ant)

library(lattice)
xyplot(tagID~hour, groups=paste(serno, ant), auto.key=TRUE, hh, xlab="Date (GMT)", ylab="motus tag ID")
```

By default, tag databases are stored in the current directory (`getwd()` in R).
You can change this by adding the `dir=` parameter to function calls; e.g.:

```R
db = tagme(proj=8, dir="c:/Users/emily/telemetry/HEGU")
```

To prevent downloading the same data many times, the `tagme()` function requires
that the database already exist, unless you use the `new=TRUE` parameter.
If you use `new=TRUE`, a new database is created, but you will be prompted
to make sure you really want to download all the data.  If you want to
avoid being prompted, e.g. if running from a script, you can add the `force=TRUE`
parameter; e.g.:

```R
## download and open a new copy of the full tag database for motus project 14,
## without prompting the user for confirmation

db = tagme(8, new=TRUE, force=TRUE, dir="/home/john/Desktop")
```

Sometimes, you might want to know approximately how much new data is available
for your project without actually downloading it.  You can do this:

```R
### ask how much new data motus.org has for your project

tellme(8)
```
This returns a named list with these items:

 - **numBatches**: number of batches of new data
 - **numRuns**: number of runs of new tag detections
 - **numHits**: number of new tag detections
 - **numGPS**: number of new GPS records
 - **numBytes**: approximate uncompressed size of data transfer required, in bytes.

Of course, *new* means data you do not already have, so the `tellme` function
needs to know where your existing tag database files are.  If they are not in the
current directory, then you can use the `dir` parameter to say where they are; e.g.:

```R
tellme(8, dir="c:/Users/emily/telemetry/HEGU")
```

If you want to know how much data is available for a project but you *do not* already
have a database for it, use the `new` parameter:

```R
tellme(8, new=TRUE)
```
Otherwise, `tellme` will return an error saying it doesn't know where your existing
database is.

### Ambiguous detections ###

As of Oct. 7, 2017, the tagme() function automatically downloads ambiguous detections.  The nature
of the ambiguity is discussed in detail [here](https://github.com/jbrzusto/motusClient/blob/master/inst/doc/ambiguous_detection_handling.md)

The new function `motusClient::clarify()` is available for users to manage these detections.
Calling it like this:

``` R
library(motusClient)
s = tagme(57)           ## connect to the local copy of the tag database for project 57
clarify(s)              ## summarize ambiguous detections in this database
```

prints a summary of all ambiguous detections in the project.  This is a table of each
unique ambiguous ID (negative motus tag ID) and what possible real tags it could be.

You can also use `clarify()` to claim ambiguous detections as your own.
Do `?clarify` from an R session for details.
