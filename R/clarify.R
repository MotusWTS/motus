#' report on or claim ambiguous tag detections
#'
#' A detections is "ambiguous" if the motus tag finder could not tell
#' which of several tags was detected, because they all produce the
#' same signal and were active at the same time.  The motus tag finder
#' uses tag deployment and lifetime metadata to decide what tags to
#' seek when, and notices when it can't distinguish between two or
#' more of them.  Detections of such tags during these periods of
#' overlap are assigned a negative motus tag ID that represents from 2
#' to 6 possible real motus tags.  The ambiguities might be real
#' (i.e. two or more tags transmitting the same signal and active at
#' the same time), or due to errors in tag registration or deployment
#' metadata.
#'
#' This function serves two purposes:
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item called with only a database dplyr::src, it reports the numbers
#' of ambiguous detections and what they could represent.
#' \item called with \code{id}, it lets you claim some of the ambiguities
#' as your own tag, so that in subsequent processing, they will appear
#' to be yours.
#' }
#'
#' This function does not (yet?) report your claim to motus.org
#'
#' WARNING: you cannot undo a claim within a copy of the database.  If
#' unsure, copy the .motus file first, then run \code{clarify} on only
#' one copy.
#'
#' @param s dplyr::src to the tag database, as returned by \code{tagme()}
#'
#' @param id if not missing, a vector of negative motus ambiguous tag IDs
#' for which you wish to claim detections.  If missing, all tags are claimed
#' over any period specified by \code{from} and \code{to}.
#'
#' @param from if not missing, the start time for your claim to
#'     ambiguous detections of tag(s) \code{id}.  If missing, you are
#'     claiming all detections up to \code{to}.  \code{from} can be a
#'     numeric timestamp, or a character string compatible with
#'     \code{lubridate::ymd}
#'
#' @param to if not missing, the end time for your claim to ambiguous
#'     detections of tag(s) \code{id}.  If missing, you are claiming
#'     all detections after \code{from}.  \code{to} can be a numeric
#'     timestamp, or a character string compatible with
#'     \code{lubridate::ymd}
#'
#' @param all.mine logical; if TRUE, claim all ambiguous detections.
#' In this case, \code{id, from} and \code{to} are ignored.
#'
#' If both \code{from} and \code{to} are missing, then all detections of
#' ambiguous tag(s) \code{id} are claimed.
#'
#' Parameters \code{id}, \code{from}, and \code{to} are recycled to the
#' length of the longest item.
#'
#' When you claim an ambiguous tag \code{T} for a period, any runs of \code{T}
#' which overlap that period at all are claimd entirely, even if they extend
#' beyond the period; i.e. runs are not split.
#'
#' @examples
#' ## s = tagme(57) ## get a dplyr::src to the tag database for project 57
#' ## clarify(s)  ## report on the ambiguous tag detections in s
#' ## clarify(all.mine=TRUE) ## claim all ambiguous tag detections as mine
#' ## clarify(id = -57) ## claim all detections of ambiguous tag -57 as mine
#' ## clarify(id = c(-72, -88, -91), from=("2017-01-02"), to=("2017-05-06")) 
#' ## claim all detections of ambiguous tags -72, -88, and -91 from
#' ##   January 2 through May 6, 2017, as mine
#'
#' @return with no parameters, returns a summary data frame of ambiguous tag detections, with these columns
#' \itemize{
#' \item ambigID; integer: negative motus ambiguous tag ID, representing multiple possible real tags
#' \item numHits; numeric: total number of detections of this ambiguity
#' \item id1; integer: first possible motus ID of real tag that this detection might represent
#' \item fullID1; character: fullID for first possible real tag, in "Project#MFGID:BI@NOMFREQ(M.MotusID)" format
#' \item id2; integer: second possible motus ID of real tag that this detection might represent
#' \item fullID2; character: fullID for second possible real tag, in same format as fullID1
#' \item ...
#' \item id6; integer: sixth possible motus ID of real tag that this detection might represent
#' \item fullID6; character: fullID for sixth possible real tag, in same format as fullID1
#' \item motusTagID; integer tag ID ambiguity was resolved to over some period
#' \item tsStart; numeric: timestamp of start of period for this ambiguity resolution
#' \item tsEnd; numeric: timestamp of end of period for this ambiguity resolution
