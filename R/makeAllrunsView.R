#' Create allruns view
#'
#' Creates a virtual table (really a 'view') in a motus database that
#' links each tag detection to all metadata available for the tag and
#' receiver. The allruns view is the same as alltags but excludes hits.
#'
#' @param db dplyr src_sqlite to detections database
#' @param name character scalar; name for the virtual table.
#'     Default: 'allruns'.
#'
#' @return a dplyr::tbl which refers to the newly-created virtual table.
#'
#' @note The new virtual table replaces any previous virtual table by the same
#' name in `db`.  The virtual table is an SQL VIEW, which will persist in `db`
#' across R sessions.
