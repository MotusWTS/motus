#' determine the model from a lotek serial number

#' The serial number determines the receiver model in most cases, but
#' for a few receivers, additional fields from the .DTA file are needed.
#'
#' @param serno character scalar; receiver serial number, e.g. "Lotek-123"
#'
#' @param extra a named character vector of additional .DTA file fields
#' Currently, this parameter is ignored.

#' @return a character scalar with the receiver model
