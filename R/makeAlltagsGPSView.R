#' Create alltagsGPS view
#'
#' Creates a virtual table (really a 'view') in a motus database that
#' links each tag detection to all metadata available for the tag and
#' receiver, including GPS metadata.
#'
#' @param src SQLite Connection
#' @param name character scalar; name for the virtual table.
#'     Default: 'alltagsGPS'.
#'
#'
#' @note The new virtual table replaces any previous virtual table by the same
#' name in \code{src}.  The virtual table is an SQL VIEW, which will persist in \code{src}
#' across R sessions.
